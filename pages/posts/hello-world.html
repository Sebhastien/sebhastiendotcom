        <h2 class="post-subheading">Intro</h2>
        <p>I've been wanting to start this blog for a very long time. I'm actually not entirely sure what has kept me from doing this for so long.</p>
        <p>Recently, I've been thinking about what I want to accomplish with the rest of my life. I've read several books to help me navigate. So far, what I have come up with is that: I'd like to spend all my time doing things I love. This includes:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Watching great TV and Movies with my Wife, Yankhaty</li>
          <li>Spending time with my best friend, my dog, Nugget</li>
          <li>Working on my fitness: Physical, Mental and Financial</li>
          <li>Building awesome calm businesses</li>
          <li>Picking up new hobbies (Currently writing Sci-fi)</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Where I am now</h2>
        <p>I estimate I am currently about 75% to where I want to be:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Yankhaty and I watched the entire Wizarding World serieses (Harry Potter and Fantastic Beasts).</li>
          <li>I've been enjoying my daily walks with Nugget and look forward to teaching him some new tricks (not barking at walking Neighbors)</li>
          <li>Yankhaty has spent a ton of time working on creating a healthy pantry. This, in addition to an awesome workout plan, has resulted in me losing 20lbs this year!</li>
          <li>This year, we have saved about 30% of our Income. I am looking forward to doing more here, and investing after we get into the house.</li>
          <li>I'm nearly done with the v1 of Talentframe, a SaaS business I've been working on developing. I have a couple ideas for some other small tools </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>What I want to do</h2>
        <p>I want to spend more time picking up new hobbies. I've known for a long time that this was something I loved doing. I just love learning, and I am good at it. However, I haven't spent a ton of time doing that these past couple of years as I've been hyper focused on building my career.</p>
        <p>Now that I have achieved the goals I have set for myself vocationally, i'd like to spend the next chapter of my life setting and achieving avocational goals.</p>
        <p>Here is the top of my list:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Learn Spanish</li>
          <li>Learn to write a sci-fi book/script</li>
          <li>Web3 Tech</li>
          <li>Complete my Open Source Computer Science degree</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>What Now?</h2>
        <p>I plan on giving myself the space to do what ever I want more often.</p>
        <p>That's it. Thats the plan.</p>
        <p>I have a huge list of web technologies, spoken languages and other "things" I'd like to learn. I plan on giving myself the space to do that.</p>
