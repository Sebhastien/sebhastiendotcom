# Sebhastien.com

My personal site. I plan on build mostly from scratch using HTML, CSS and Vanilla JS.

## Roadmap

* Build the Site with HTML, CSS, and JS
* Build a web server in rust? Host on Raspberry pi
* Create a small CSS framework to help with styling
* Create a small JS library (Alpine.js) to help with interactivity
